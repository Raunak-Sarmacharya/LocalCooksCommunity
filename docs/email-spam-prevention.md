# Email Spam Prevention Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive steps to prevent your Local Cooks Community emails from going to spam folders. Email deliverability is crucial for user engagement and business operations.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Email Configuration

**Current Issue**: Your Firebase auth email link was pointing to `/auth-page` instead of `/auth`
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Updated to correct URL path

**Next Steps**:
```bash
# Update your .env file with proper email settings
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=noreply@yourdomain.com  # Use your actual domain
EMAIL_PASS=your-actual-password
EMAIL_FROM=Local Cooks Community <noreply@yourdomain.com>
```

### 2. Domain-Based Email Address

**Critical**: Replace any Gmail/Yahoo addresses with professional domain-based emails.

❌ **Bad**: `localcooks123@gmail.com`
✅ **Good**: `noreply@localcooks.community`

### 3. DNS Records Setup

Configure these DNS records for your domain:

#### SPF Record
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.hostinger.com ~all
```

#### DKIM Record
Contact your email provider (Hostinger) to set up DKIM signing.

#### DMARC Record
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```
