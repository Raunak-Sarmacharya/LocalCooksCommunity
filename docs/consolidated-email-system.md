# Consolidated Email System for Document Approvals

## Overview

The email system has been updated to send only **one consolidated email** when all documents are approved for both chefs and delivery partners, instead of sending individual emails for each document approval.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Email Functions

Added two new email generation functions in `server/email.ts`:

- `generateChefAllDocumentsApprovedEmail()` - For chef applications
- `generateDeliveryPartnerAllDocumentsApprovedEmail()` - For delivery partner applications

### 2. Updated API Routes

Modified the document verification endpoints in `api/index.js`:

- **Chef Applications**: `/api/applications/:id/document-verification`
- **Delivery Partner Applications**: `/api/delivery-partner-applications/:id/document-verification`

### 3. Updated Server Routes

Modified the chef document verification route in `server/routes.ts`:

- **Chef Applications**: `/api/applications/:id/document-verification`

## How It Works

### For Chefs
- **Documents**: Food Safety License, Food Establishment Certificate
- **Trigger**: When both documents are approved
- **Email Content**: Lists all approved documents in one email

### For Delivery Partners
- **Documents**: Driver's License, Vehicle Registration, Vehicle Insurance
- **Trigger**: When all three documents are approved
- **Email Content**: Lists all approved documents in one email

## Email Content

Both email types include:
- âœ… Congratulations message
- ðŸ“„ List of all approved documents
- ðŸ’¬ Admin feedback (if provided)
- ðŸ”— Link to dashboard
- ðŸ“§ Support contact information

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Email Spam**: Users receive only one email instead of multiple
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear, consolidated information
3. **Professional Communication**: Single, comprehensive approval notification
4. **Easier Management**: Less email clutter for users

## Technical Implementation

### Logic Flow
1. Admin approves/rejects documents via admin interface
2. System checks if ALL documents are approved
3. If yes, sends one consolidated email
4. If no, no email is sent (user can check dashboard for status)

### Email Tracking
- **Chef emails**: `all_docs_approved_chef_{applicationId}_{timestamp}`
- **Delivery emails**: `all_docs_approved_delivery_{applicationId}_{timestamp}`

## Migration Notes

- âœ… Individual document status emails have been removed
- âœ… Existing email templates are preserved for other use cases
- âœ… No changes to admin interface required
- âœ… No changes to user dashboard required

## Testing

The new email system has been tested and verified to work correctly for both chef and delivery partner applications.
