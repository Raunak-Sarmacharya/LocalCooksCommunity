# Troubleshooting Vercel Deployment Issues

If you're experiencing issues with your Vercel deployment, particularly the `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` error, here are some troubleshooting steps:

## Common Vercel Errors and Solutions

### FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED Error

This error occurs when your serverless function fails to execute properly. Common causes:

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Check if your DATABASE_URL is correctly set in Vercel environment variables
   - Make sure your Neon database is active and not in "paused" state
   - Test database connectivity using the `/api/health` endpoint

2. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - Make sure you've set `SESSION_SECRET` in your Vercel environment variables
   - Setting `NODE_ENV=production` can help with certain configurations

3. **Function Timeout**
   - If your function takes too long to execute, it might time out
   - Reduce the complexity of your API endpoints
   - Keep database queries efficient

4. **Memory Limitations**
   - Vercel has memory limits for serverless functions
   - Reduce the memory footprint of your functions
   - Consider using edge functions for memory-intensive operations

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Function Logs**
   - In Vercel dashboard, navigate to your deployment
   - Click on "Functions" to see function logs
   - Look for error messages or timeouts

2. **Test API Endpoints Individually**
   - Try accessing each API endpoint separately to identify which one is failing
   - Use `/api/health` to check database connection status and environment variables
   - Use `/api/init-db` to initialize database tables if they don't exist

3. **Simplify Problematic Functions**
   - Temporarily comment out complex operations
   - Add more error handling and logging
   - Implement retries for unreliable operations

4. **Deployment Environment Differences**
   - Some code that works locally might not work in Vercel's environment
   - Watch out for file path differences, environmental dependencies, etc.

## Optimizing for Vercel Deployment

1. **Cold Starts**
   - Serverless functions have "cold starts" when they haven't been used recently
   - Minimize dependencies to reduce cold start time
   - Consider keeping functions minimal and focused

2. **Database Connections**
   - Use connection pooling with small pool sizes
   - Always close connections when done
   - For Neon, use their serverless driver

3. **Session Management**
   - Store sessions in the database rather than in-memory
   - Use short session expiration times
   - Consider stateless authentication with JWTs

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Double-check that all required environment variables are set
   - Make sure URLs include the correct protocol (http/https)
   - Use the Vercel dashboard to manage environment variables

## Getting Additional Help

If you're still experiencing issues after trying these solutions:

1. Check Vercel status page for any ongoing incidents
2. Review Vercel documentation for serverless function limitations
3. Inspect the network tab in browser dev tools for more detailed error responses
4. Review recent code changes that might have introduced the issue
