# Chef Resources: Your Guide to Starting a Legal Food Business in Canada

*Currently serving Newfoundland & Labrador — built to scale across Canada*

---

This guide walks you through every legal and practical step to launch a food business in Canada. Whether you're a home cook with a signature recipe, a trained chef starting a catering brand, or an entrepreneur scaling from farmers' markets to wholesale — this is your roadmap.

The regulatory details here reflect **Newfoundland and Labrador**, where Local Cooks currently operates. The framework — food safety certification, business registration, insurance, and licensing — follows the same structure across every Canadian province. Where you see "Service NL," your province will have an equivalent agency (e.g., Public Health Units in Ontario, regional Health Authorities in British Columbia). The principles are universal; the agencies differ.

---

## Understanding the Regulatory Landscape

Canada's food system operates on three levels. Knowing which ones apply to you prevents costly surprises.

| Level | Regulator | When It Applies |
|:------|:----------|:----------------|
| **Federal** | Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) | Selling across provincial borders, importing, or exporting |
| **Provincial** | Service NL (in Newfoundland & Labrador) | All food businesses operating within the province |
| **Municipal** | City of St. John's (or your municipality) | Zoning, business permits, market vending |

Most food entrepreneurs starting locally need only provincial and municipal compliance. Federal requirements kick in when you ship products across provincial borders or internationally.

---

## Step 1: Get Your Food Safety Certification

A Food Handler Certificate proves you understand temperature control, cross-contamination prevention, hygiene protocols, and safe food handling.

**Why it matters:**

- **Legal requirement.** At least one certified food handler must be present during all operating hours at any food premises in NL (*Food Premises Regulations*, Section 6.1).
- **Kitchen access.** Commercial kitchens require valid certification before granting access.
- **Professional credibility.** Demonstrates commitment to food safety to customers, regulators, and business partners.

---

## Step 2: Register Your Business

### Choosing Your Business Structure

| Structure | Registration | Liability | Best For |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|:---------|
| **Sole Proprietorship** | No provincial registration required in NL (registering a business name is recommended) | Personal liability | Solo operators, farmers' market sellers |
| **Partnership** | Register with Registry of Companies | Shared personal liability | Two or more partners |
| **Incorporation** | File with Registry of Companies | Limited liability protection | Growing businesses, multiple partners, seeking investment |

Registry of Companies: [gov.nl.ca/gs](https://www.gov.nl.ca/gs/)

### Home-Based Food Business Registration

If you plan to operate from a home kitchen, you must register with the Environmental Public Health department.

**Process:**

1. Download the registration form from [gov.nl.ca/hcs/files/publichealth-envhealth-home-based-food-industry.pdf](https://www.gov.nl.ca/hcs/files/publichealth-envhealth-home-based-food-industry.pdf)
2. Complete all sections: business and contact information, ingredient list, food types, preparation methods, and where you plan to sell
3. Submit to your nearest Government Service Centre

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Cost** | Free |
| **Validity** | One-time registration (does not expire) |
| **Inspection** | You may be inspected by Environmental Health Officers |

> **Read the guidelines carefully.** Specific foods are prohibited from home preparation — see the list below.

### What You Can and Cannot Prepare at Home

**Permitted (low-risk, shelf-stable):**

- Baked goods (cookies, cakes, breads, pastries)
- Jams, jellies, and preserves (properly acidified)
- Candy and confections
- Granola and cereal products
- Spice blends and dry mixes

**Prohibited (high-risk):**

- Raw meat, fish, shellfish, and poultry products
- Cut fruits and vegetables
- Fresh juices processed on-site
- Fermented products (kimchi, kombucha)
- Cream pastries, cheesecakes, meringue pies
- Canned foods with pH ≥ 4.6 (e.g., salsa, vegetables)
- Products containing meat, fish, dairy, or eggs (except when used in shelf-stable baked goods)

**If your product falls in the prohibited category, you need a commercial kitchen.**

---

## Step 3: Get Liability Insurance

Insurance protects your business, your personal assets, and the kitchen you operate in. Nearly all commercial kitchens require proof of insurance before granting access.

### What You Need

| Coverage | Minimum Limit | Purpose |
|:---------|:--------------|:--------|
| **Commercial General Liability (CGL)** | $2,000,000 aggregate | Covers accidents, slip-and-fall injuries, property damage |
| **Product Liability** | $2,000,000 aggregate | Covers food poisoning, undeclared allergen claims |
| **Damage to Premises Rented** | $300,000 | Covers accidental damage to the kitchen (fire, water, etc.) |
| **Additional Insured** | Kitchen named on your policy | Extends your coverage to the kitchen for claims arising from your activities |

### Recommended: FLIP Insurance

FLIP (Food Liability Insurance Program) specializes in affordable coverage for food businesses renting commercial kitchen space. It is the most widely used option for shared kitchen renters across Canada.

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Cost** | Starting at approximately $25.92/month or $299/year |
| **Additional Insureds** | Free and unlimited — add kitchens at no extra cost |
| **Deductible** | None on liability claims |
| **Purchasing** | Instant online — certificate available immediately |
| **Add-ons** | Equipment coverage (+$8.25/mo), cyber liability (+$8.25/mo), excess liability (from $41.67/mo) |
| **Website** | [fliprogram.com](https://www.fliprogram.com/) |

**How to purchase:**

1. Visit [fliprogram.com](https://www.fliprogram.com/) and select "Commercial Kitchen Renters"
2. Complete the online application (5–10 minutes)
3. Get an instant quote and purchase
4. Download your Certificate of Insurance (COI) immediately
5. Add your kitchen as an Additional Insured — free through the FLIP dashboard

### Understanding "Additional Insured"

When you add a kitchen as an Additional Insured on your policy, the kitchen is covered under **your** insurance for claims arising from **your** activities. This is standard practice across the industry.

**Example:** You prepare food in a rented kitchen. A customer experiences a severe allergic reaction and sues both you and the kitchen facility. Because the kitchen is named as an Additional Insured on your policy, your insurer provides the kitchen's legal defence for claims related to your operations — protecting the kitchen owner's own policy and keeping their premiums stable.

### Alternative Providers

| Provider | Specialty | Website |
|:---------|:----------|:--------|
| **Zensurance** | Online brokerage with food & beverage packages | [zensurance.com](https://www.zensurance.com) |
| **BFL Canada** | Food manufacturing and commercial liability | [bflcanada.ca](https://www.bflcanada.ca) |
| **The Co-operators** | Traditional carrier with food business packages | [cooperators.ca](https://www.cooperators.ca) |

Whatever provider you choose, confirm that your policy includes: minimum $2M general liability, product liability, damage to rented premises, and the ability to add additional insureds.

---

## Step 4: Obtain Your Food Establishment Licence

Any food business operating from a commercial kitchen — or a home kitchen licensed as a food establishment — must hold a Food Establishment Licence from Service NL under the *Food Premises Act*.

### For Commercial Kitchen Users

**What you need:**

1. **Completed licence application** — download from [gov.nl.ca/gs/licences/env-health/food/premises/](https://www.gov.nl.ca/gs/licences/env-health/food/premises/)
2. **Floor plan** of the kitchen you'll be operating in (your kitchen manager will provide this)
3. **Municipal approval** (if applicable — in St. John's, confirm zoning with Planning and Development at planning@stjohns.ca)
4. **Proof of food safety training** — your certificate from Step 1
5. **Rental agreement or letter** confirming your access to the licensed facility

**Submission process:**

1. Compile all documents
2. Submit to your regional Service NL office or Government Service Centre
3. Pay applicable fees (check current rates with Service NL)
4. An Environmental Health Officer may conduct an inspection
5. Receive your licence upon approval

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Processing time** | 2–8 weeks (varies by location and inspection availability) |
| **Renewal** | Annual — Service NL will notify you of renewal requirements |

> **Important distinction:** The kitchen's own Food Establishment Licence covers the *facility*. If you operate as an independent business under your own brand (catering, market sales, wholesale), you likely need your own licence. Check with your local Environmental Health Officer to confirm your specific situation.

### For Home Kitchen Users

If you want your home kitchen licensed as a food establishment:

1. Complete the same Food Establishment Licence application
2. Your home must meet all commercial kitchen standards: commercial-grade equipment, proper ventilation and lighting, adequate refrigeration, separate food preparation area, two-compartment sink for washing and sanitizing, screened windows, and pest control measures
3. Submit a floor plan of your home kitchen
4. Pass an Environmental Health inspection

> **Cost reality:** Retrofitting a home kitchen to commercial standards typically costs $10,000–$50,000 or more. Renting commercial kitchen space at $20–$50/hour — paying only for the time you use — is often more practical and allows you to start producing much sooner.

## Step 5: Federal Requirements (If Applicable)

### Do You Need a CFIA Licence?

The Safe Food for Canadians Regulations (SFCR), administered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), apply to food businesses that trade beyond their home province.

| Your Activity | Federal Licence Required? |
|:--------------|:--------------------------|
| Sell only within your province | No |
| Serve directly to consumers (restaurant, food truck, catering) | No |
| Sell across provincial or territorial borders | **Yes** |
| Import ingredients from outside Canada | **Yes** |
| Export products internationally | **Yes** |

### If You Need a Licence

1. Create a My CFIA account at [inspection.gc.ca/my-cfia](https://www.inspection.gc.ca/my-cfia)
2. Develop a **Preventive Control Plan (PCP)** — a written food safety plan covering hazard identification, critical control points, corrective actions, and verification
3. Meet **traceability requirements** — track products one step back (your suppliers) and one step forward (your business customers)
4. Submit your licence application through the My CFIA portal

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Cost** | $250 for a 2-year licence |
| **More information** | [inspection.canada.ca/food-licences](https://inspection.canada.ca/food-licences) |
| **Toolkit** | [inspection.canada.ca/food-safety-industry/toolkit-food-businesses](https://inspection.canada.ca/food-safety-industry/toolkit-food-businesses) |

### Traceability Best Practice

Even if you don't need a federal licence, maintaining basic traceability records is a best practice that protects your business in the event of a recall or complaint:

- **One step back:** Keep supplier invoices with lot numbers for all ingredients
- **One step forward:** Keep sales records for business-to-business transactions (direct-to-consumer retail sales are exempt from this requirement)

---

## Your Path Through Local Cooks

Local Cooks connects food entrepreneurs with licensed commercial kitchens. Here's how the process works.

### 1. Create Your Profile and Apply

- Create a chef profile on Local Cooks
- Browse available commercial kitchens in your area
- Apply to kitchens that match your needs — hours, equipment, location, and pricing
- Upload your Food Handler Certificate and other required documents as part of your application
- Kitchen managers typically respond within a few business days

### 2. Connect with Your Kitchen Manager

Once a kitchen manager reviews and advances your application:

- Use the platform's built-in messaging system to communicate directly with the kitchen manager
- Exchange the documentation you'll need for your Food Establishment Licence application: kitchen address, floor plan, licence number, and equipment list
- Provide your Certificate of Insurance with the kitchen named as Additional Insured
- Complete any additional requirements the kitchen manager has set (these vary by facility)
- The approval process has multiple stages — managers verify documents and qualifications before granting full booking access

### 3. Book and Operate

Once fully approved:

- Book kitchen time slots directly through the platform
- Add storage and equipment rentals to your bookings as needed
- Pay securely through the platform
- Manage your upcoming and past bookings from your dashboard

> **Before your first session:** Coordinate with your kitchen manager for an in-person orientation. This is standard practice across professional shared kitchens and typically covers equipment operation, cleaning protocols, emergency procedures, storage assignments, and facility-specific rules. Do not skip this — it protects both you and the facility.

## Home-Based vs. Commercial Kitchen

| Factor | Home-Based | Commercial Kitchen |
|:-------|:-----------|:-------------------|
| **Startup cost** | Low upfront, but retrofitting is expensive | Pay-per-use — no capital investment in equipment |
| **Food types** | Low-risk only (baked goods, jams, dry mixes) | Any food product, including high-risk |
| **Equipment** | Must meet commercial standards personally | Commercial-grade equipment provided |
| **Scalability** | Limited by space and regulations | Flexible — book more hours as your business grows |
| **Licensing** | Home inspected and licensed separately | Kitchen already licensed and inspected |
| **Insurance** | May be more expensive; fewer provider options | Standard commercial rates; FLIP and others specialize in this |
| **Networking** | Isolated | Work alongside other food entrepreneurs |
| **Best for** | Baked goods, jams, dry mixes sold at local markets | Any food business wanting flexibility, professional equipment, and the ability to prepare regulated products |

---

## Business and Tax Essentials

### GST/HST Registration

- **Required** if your annual revenue exceeds $30,000 (the small supplier threshold)
- Register through the Canada Revenue Agency: [canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html)
- In Newfoundland and Labrador, the combined **HST rate is 15%**
- A Business Number (BN) is issued when you register for GST/HST

### Record Keeping

The Canada Revenue Agency requires you to keep business records for **6 years** from the end of the tax year they relate to. Track:

- All ingredient and food purchases
- Kitchen rental payments and receipts
- Insurance premiums
- Equipment and supply purchases
- Sales revenue by channel (markets, wholesale, direct, online)
- Vehicle and transportation costs (if applicable)

### WorkplaceNL (Workers' Compensation)

If you hire even one assistant — casual, part-time, or contract — you must register with **WorkplaceNL** to provide workers' compensation coverage.

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **NIC Code** | 9210 (Food Services) or 9221 (Caterers) |
| **2025 Rate** | $1.28 per $100 of assessable payroll |
| **Registration** | [workplacenl.ca/employers/register-my-business/](https://workplacenl.ca/employers/register-my-business/) |

> **Tip:** Consider consulting an accountant for tax planning. Kitchen rental fees, insurance, packaging, ingredients, and many other food business expenses are tax-deductible.

---

## Operating in a Shared Kitchen

A shared kitchen requires a higher level of discipline than a private workspace. Your hygiene and practices affect every other business operating in the same facility.

### The Clean-In, Clean-Out Rule

- **Arrival:** Sanitize your station before you start. Never assume the previous user left it perfect.
- **Departure:** Leave the station inspection-ready — surfaces scrubbed, rinsed, and sanitized; sinks empty and clean; floors swept and spot-mopped around your area; all equipment returned to its designated position.

### Allergen Responsibility

You cannot guarantee an allergen-free environment in a shared kitchen. Manage risk by:

- Keeping high-risk allergens (peanuts, shellfish, flour) in tightly sealed, clearly labelled containers
- Performing high-allergen tasks at the end of your session or in a designated zone when possible
- Adding a "May contain traces of..." statement to your labels, acknowledging the shared production facility
- Disclosing all ingredients and allergens in your products to the kitchen manager

### Storage Protocols

- **Label everything** in shared storage with your name or business name, the product name, and the date
- **The 6-inch rule:** Nothing sits directly on the floor — use shelves or dunnage racks
- **No commingling:** Follow the facility's vertical storage hierarchy strictly (raw below ready-to-eat, always)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long does it take to go from zero to first legal sale?**
Typically 4–10 weeks: Food Handler Certificate (1 day), insurance (instant), home business registration (1–2 weeks), Food Establishment Licence (2–8 weeks).

**Can I start selling before I have all my licences?**
No. All required certifications, registrations, and licences must be in place before you legally sell food products. Operating without proper documentation can result in fines, business closure, and personal liability.

**Do I need a licence just to sell at farmers' markets?**
You need your Food Handler Certificate and business registration at minimum. Many markets also require proof of licensing and insurance. Check with your specific market's requirements and submit documentation to organizers at least 14 days before the event (Service NL requirement for temporary food establishments).

**Can I share a Food Handler Certificate with my business partner?**
No. Each person handling food should have their own certificate. At least one certified person must be present during all hours of operation.

**What if I want to expand beyond Newfoundland?**
You will need a Safe Food for Canadians Licence from CFIA ($250 for 2 years) and must meet federal labelling, traceability, and preventive control requirements.

**What happens during an inspection?**
Inspectors assess food handling practices, facility cleanliness, equipment condition, temperature control, pest control, and food safety training documentation. Critical violations (direct risk of foodborne illness) must be corrected immediately. Non-critical items receive a compliance period. Inspection reports for the previous two years are publicly accessible.

**Can I prepare some products at home and others in a commercial kitchen?**
Yes, but you need proper licensing for each location. Keep detailed records of where each product is prepared.

**How do I add a kitchen as an Additional Insured?**
Through your insurance provider's online portal. With FLIP, this is instant and free — enter the kitchen's legal business name and address, then generate an updated Certificate of Insurance.
