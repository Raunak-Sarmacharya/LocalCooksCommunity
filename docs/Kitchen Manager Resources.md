# Kitchen Manager Resources: The Complete Guide to Operating a Shared Commercial Kitchen

*Currently serving Newfoundland & Labrador — built to scale across Canada*

---

A shared commercial kitchen is not a passive rental. You are the facility steward. When multiple food businesses operate under one roof, risks multiply — cross-contamination, allergens, equipment damage, liability gaps. This guide helps you manage those risks, stay compliant, and build a thriving kitchen community that attracts serious food entrepreneurs.

This resource draws on official provincial and federal regulations, public-health guidance from across Canada (including the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health shared kitchen guidance — the most comprehensive owner's guide published in Canada), and industry best practices from leading shared-kitchen networks in North America.

While the regulatory specifics here reflect **Newfoundland and Labrador**, the framework — licensing, insurance, risk assessment, operations — follows the same structure across every Canadian province. Where you see "Service NL," your province will have an equivalent agency.

---

## Part 1 — Your Legal Foundation

### 1.1 Food Establishment Licence (Service NL)

Every commercial kitchen that produces, prepares, stores, or sells food in Newfoundland and Labrador must hold a valid **Food Establishment Licence** issued by Service NL under the *Food Premises Act*.

**How to apply:**

1. Complete the Food and/or Tobacco Licence Application from the Service NL website: [gov.nl.ca/gs/licences/env-health/food/](https://www.gov.nl.ca/gs/licences/env-health/food/)
2. Submit a detailed floor plan showing all equipment positions, room dimensions, sanitary facilities (handwash basins, washrooms), refrigerated and dry storage areas, waste disposal zones, ventilation systems, and entry/exit points
3. Obtain municipal zoning approval if your municipality requires it — in St. John's, confirm your property is zoned for commercial food use by contacting Planning and Development at planning@stjohns.ca
4. Provide proof that you or a designated staff member holds recognized food safety training — at least one certified food handler must be present during every hour the kitchen is in operation (*Food Premises Regulations*, Section 6.1)

**What happens next:**

- An Environmental Health Officer conducts a pre-opening inspection before any licence is issued
- Once licensed, your kitchen is assigned a risk category that determines inspection frequency

**Official resources:**

- Fixed and Mobile Food Premises requirements: [gov.nl.ca/gs/licences/env-health/food/premises/](https://www.gov.nl.ca/gs/licences/env-health/food/premises/)
- Full text of the Food Premises Regulations: [assembly.nl.ca/legislation/sr/regulations/rc961022.htm](https://assembly.nl.ca/legislation/sr/regulations/rc961022.htm)

### 1.2 Understanding the NL Inspection System

Newfoundland uses a risk-based inspection model. Frequency depends on how likely your kitchen's activities could contribute to a foodborne illness outbreak.

| Risk Level | Inspection Frequency | Typical Activities |
|:-----------|:---------------------|:-------------------|
| **High Risk** | 4 times per year | Raw meat/seafood processing, large-volume catering, multi-user kitchens with diverse food types |
| **Medium Risk** | 2 times per year | Bakeries, moderate food prep, limited menu variety |
| **Low Risk** | Once every 2 years | Pre-packaged food sales, low-risk dry goods only |

**Inspectors issue findings in two categories:**

- **Critical items** — violations that can directly cause foodborne illness. Must be corrected immediately or the kitchen may be closed.
- **Non-critical items** — preventive issues (e.g., missing thermometer in fridge, dirty handwash basin). A compliance period is given.

**Common inspection areas:** food sources and handling practices, facility sanitary condition, equipment condition and functionality, utensil sanitization, pest control measures, chemical storage separation, maintenance and cleanliness, water supply safety, and presence of a certified food handler during operation.

All inspection reports are published online for the previous two years and are publicly accessible.

> **Pro tip for shared kitchens:** In many Canadian jurisdictions, a Public Health inspection may be required for *each individual renter* using the shared kitchen — the kitchen's own inspection does not automatically cover all businesses operating within it. Communicate this to your renters and help them through the process.

### 1.3 WorkplaceNL Registration (Workers' Compensation)

**If your kitchen business is incorporated**, you must register with WorkplaceNL regardless of how many workers you have — even if you are the only person.

**If you are a sole proprietorship or partnership** with no employees, registration is not mandatory. However, the moment you hire any worker — even part-time, casual, or subcontracted — you must register.

| NIC Code | Industry Description | 2025 Assessment Rate |
|:---------|:---------------------|:---------------------|
| 9210 | Food Services | $1.28 per $100 of payroll |
| 9211 | Restaurants, Licensed | $1.28 per $100 of payroll |
| 9221 | Caterers | $1.28 per $100 of payroll |

- Maximum assessable earnings per worker: $99,345 per year
- Minimum annual assessment: $50
- Registration: [workplacenl.ca/employers/register-my-business/](https://workplacenl.ca/employers/register-my-business/)

> **Important consideration:** If your kitchen renters are independent businesses (not your employees), they are responsible for their own WorkplaceNL coverage. However, confirm this with WorkplaceNL — if the relationship could be interpreted as employer-worker, you may have obligations.

### 1.4 Fire Safety and Suppression Systems

Newfoundland adopts **NFPA 96** (*Standard for Ventilation Control and Fire Protection of Commercial Cooking Operations*) for commercial kitchen fire protection.

**Key requirements:**

- Any commercial kitchen using equipment that generates grease-laden vapours (fryers, grills, woks) must have an **automatic fire suppression system**
- **UL-300 compliant** wet chemical systems are the current standard across Canada
- The suppression system must be **inspected semi-annually** by a certified provider, who places a dated tag on the system
- If you renovate or reconfigure cooking equipment, existing grease ducts, exhaust equipment, and kitchen hoods must be brought into compliance with the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC)

**Additional fire safety requirements:**

- **Class "K" portable fire extinguishers** must be present in kitchens with commercial cooking equipment
- Regular testing and maintenance documentation must be kept
- St. John's provides a fire safety planning guide at [stjohns.ca](https://www.stjohns.ca/en/living-in-st-johns/resources/Documents/Guide-to-Fire-Safety-Planning.pdf)

### 1.5 Federal Considerations

If any of your renters trade inter-provincially (e.g., shipping products from St. John's to Halifax), or if your facility performs processing activities on behalf of such renters (co-packing, labelling, grading), you may need to understand the **Safe Food for Canadians Regulations (SFCR)** and how they affect your facility.

The CFIA explicitly recognizes shared-use facilities as critical nodes in the food supply chain. If your facility provides processing services for tenants who trade inter-provincially, the facility itself may require a Safe Food for Canadians Licence.

## Part 2 — Insurance: Protecting Your Facility and Your Business

### 2.1 Your Insurance Portfolio

As a shared commercial kitchen operator, you need more comprehensive coverage than a single-operator kitchen.

**Commercial General Liability (CGL)**

- Recommended minimum: **$5,000,000 aggregate** for a multi-user facility
- Covers: slip-and-fall injuries, property damage to visitors/vendors, legal defence costs
- Does NOT cover claims arising from a renter's food products — that is why renters need their own policy

**Property Insurance**

- Covers: building (if owned), tenant improvements, commercial-grade equipment, inventory, supplies
- Should include **business interruption coverage** for income replacement if the kitchen becomes unusable
- Verify coverage is at **replacement cost**, not depreciated value

**Equipment Breakdown Coverage**

- Protects against mechanical or electrical failure of critical assets (walk-in coolers, ovens, dishwashers, ventilation)
- Separate from property insurance and often overlooked

**Umbrella/Excess Liability**

- Adds $2–5 million above your CGL for catastrophic claims

**Cyber Liability**

- Relevant if you handle digital bookings and payment data
- Covers data breaches and associated costs

### 2.2 Recommended Insurance Providers

| Provider | Specialty | Website |
|:---------|:----------|:--------|
| **BFL CANADA** | Food & beverage manufacturing, processing risk | [bflcanada.ca/food-and-beverage/](https://www.bflcanada.ca/food-and-beverage/) |
| **Zensurance** | Online brokerage with food & beverage packages | [zensurance.com](https://www.zensurance.com/manufacturing-insurance/food-and-beverage) |
| **Aligned Insurance** | Food liability specialists | [alignedinsurance.com](https://www.alignedinsurance.com/) |
| **The Co-operators** | Traditional carrier, commercial property + liability packages | [cooperators.ca](https://www.cooperators.ca/) |

**Questions to ask your broker:**

1. Do you insure shared/multi-tenant commercial kitchens specifically?
2. What minimum limits do you recommend given my facility size and renter volume?
3. Is equipment breakdown included, or do I need a separate rider?
4. How are claims handled when damage is caused by a renter vs. equipment failure?
5. Does my policy require renters to carry their own CGL with me as additional insured?

### 2.3 Requiring Renter Insurance: The "Additional Insured" Framework

This is the single most important risk-transfer mechanism for your kitchen. **Every renter must carry their own Commercial General Liability policy and name your kitchen as an Additional Insured.**

When you are listed as an additional insured on a renter's policy, you are covered under *their* insurance for claims arising from *their* activities in your kitchen.

**Real-world scenario:** Chef Sarah prepares catered meals in your kitchen. A client develops a severe allergic reaction and sues both Sarah and your kitchen. Because your kitchen is named as an additional insured on Sarah's policy, her insurer provides your legal defence and covers eligible damages — protecting your own policy from a claim and keeping your premiums stable.

**Minimum renter coverage requirements:**

| Coverage Type | Minimum Limit | Why It Matters |
|:--------------|:--------------|:---------------|
| **Commercial General Liability** | $2,000,000 aggregate | Industry standard for food businesses in Canada |
| **Product Liability** | $2,000,000 aggregate | Covers food poisoning, undeclared allergens |
| **Damage to Premises Rented** | $300,000 | Covers accidental fire or water damage to your kitchen |
| **Additional Insured** | Your kitchen named | Extends renter's coverage to you for their operations |

**Recommended provider for renters:** FLIP Insurance — starting at approximately $25.92/month or $299/year, with free and unlimited additional insureds, no deductible on liability claims, and instant online purchasing. Website: [fliprogram.com](https://www.fliprogram.com/)

### 2.4 Verifying Certificates of Insurance (COI)

Before a renter's first booking, verify every COI for:

1. **Certificate Holder / Additional Insured** — your kitchen's exact legal name and address must appear
2. **Description of Operations** — should reference your kitchen as additional insured
3. **Effective and Expiry Dates** — must cover the full rental period with no gaps
4. **Coverage Limits** — meet or exceed your minimums
5. **Product Liability and Damage to Premises Rented** — both must be listed
6. **Insurer** — must be a licensed, legitimate insurance company

**Red flags to reject:** expired or not-yet-effective dates, your kitchen not mentioned, limits below $2M, missing product liability or premises damage coverage, or an unknown/unlicensed insurer.

**Best practice:** Set calendar reminders 60 and 30 days before each renter's policy expires. Suspend booking access if a renewed COI is not received before the expiry date. No exceptions — a lapsed policy means suspended kitchen access immediately.

## Part 3 — Risk Assessment: Accepting New Renters Safely

### 3.1 The HACCP-Based Risk Assessment

Before accepting any new renter, conduct a structured risk assessment using HACCP principles (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) to evaluate each prospective renter's impact on your facility and existing users.

**Assess the following risk categories for every applicant:**

**Biological Risks (Microbiological)**

- Will the renter handle raw meat, poultry, seafood, or dairy?
- Could their process introduce pathogens (Salmonella, Listeria, E. coli) into shared areas?
- If you already host a bakery, adding a meat processor creates significant cross-contamination potential — consider whether your facility layout and scheduling can adequately separate these activities

**Chemical Risks**

- Will they bring chemicals for processing or preservation?
- Chemical storage must be locked, labelled, and separated from food areas

**Physical Risks**

- Do they use glass packaging? If so, you need a glass breakage policy and cleanup protocol
- Any sharp or unusual equipment that could create hazards for other users?

**Allergen Risks — The Critical One**

This is the highest-stakes risk in a shared kitchen. If one renter uses peanuts and another markets their product as peanut-free, you have a serious liability exposure.

**Allergen management strategies:**

- Consider whether your kitchen will allow certain priority allergens at all
- No renter in a shared kitchen should make "allergen-free" claims — labels must state the product was produced in a facility that handles the relevant allergen
- Schedule allergen-containing production at the end of the day or after thorough sanitation
- Use colour-coded labels for storage (e.g., red for contains nuts, blue for dairy)
- Require all renters to disclose every ingredient and allergen in their products during application

**Priority allergens in Canada (Health Canada):** Peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat/triticale, soy, sesame, mustard, crustaceans, molluscs, fish, and sulphites.

**Risk Assessment Template:**

| Hazard to Other Renters | Existing Controls | New Controls Needed |
|:------------------------|:------------------|:--------------------|
| Peanuts may contaminate other food | No peanut-free claims policy; end-of-day scheduling; sanitation program | Peanuts brought in one day only, NOT stored in facility |
| Glass jars may break and contaminate food | None currently | Implement glass cleanup procedure |
| Raw poultry may cross-contaminate RTE products in storage | Storage program; shelf labelling; daily inspections | Dedicated raw-only fridge shelf; mandatory top-to-bottom storage order |

### 3.2 The Pre-Rental Screening Checklist

**Tier 1: Non-Negotiable (no booking without these)**

- [ ] Valid Food Handler Certificate — current, from a recognized provider
- [ ] Certificate of Insurance — $2M CGL, product liability, damage to premises rented, your kitchen as additional insured
- [ ] Signed rental agreement
- [ ] Completed risk assessment (allergens, products, processes)

**Tier 2: Required Before Ongoing Operations**

- [ ] Business registration or licence (if applicable)
- [ ] Food Establishment Licence from Service NL — or documented proof they have applied and are working with an Environmental Health Officer
- [ ] Emergency contact information
- [ ] Product descriptions with full ingredient lists and allergen declarations
- [ ] Orientation completion acknowledgment (signed)

## Part 4 — Onboarding Chefs

The best shared kitchens in North America follow a structured onboarding pipeline. Here is the process for working with chefs through Local Cooks.

### Step 1: Application Review (Days 1–3)

When a chef applies through Local Cooks:

- Review their profile: food type, production volume, schedule needs, experience level
- Confirm their Food Handler Certificate is uploaded and current
- Do a quick compatibility check: will their products conflict with existing renters (allergens, equipment needs, storage)?
- **Respond promptly** — fast response times are the #1 factor in attracting quality renters. The platform provides in-app notifications when new applications arrive.

### Step 2: Information Exchange via Platform Messaging (Days 3–10)

Once you advance their application, use the platform's built-in messaging system to exchange information.

**You provide:**

- Your kitchen's legal business name and full address
- Your Food Establishment Licence number and expiry date
- Detailed floor plan (the chef will need this for their own licence application)
- Complete equipment list with specifications
- Kitchen rules, operating hours, and pricing
- Insurance requirements (minimum coverages, additional insured requirement, COI submission deadline)
- Allergen policies and restrictions

**You request:**

- Certificate of Insurance with your kitchen as additional insured
- Business registration details
- Their Food Establishment Licence (or proof of application)
- Full product description with ingredient lists and allergen declarations
- Emergency contact information

### Step 3: Document Verification (Days 10–14)

Before scheduling anything:

- [ ] COI verified — correct name, address, limits, dates, additional insured wording
- [ ] Food Handler Certificate confirmed valid and not expired
- [ ] Agreement signed and any deposit collected
- [ ] Risk assessment completed — no unresolvable allergen or safety conflicts

If anything is missing, communicate clearly what's needed and set a deadline. Do not schedule orientation or kitchen time until every document is verified.

### Step 4: In-Person Orientation (1.5–2 Hours)

This is not optional. Every renter, regardless of experience, goes through orientation.

**Facility tour:**

- Complete walkthrough of all areas: prep zones, cooking stations, storage (dry, refrigerated, frozen), waste disposal, washrooms, emergency exits
- Point out fire extinguishers, fire suppression system pull stations, first aid kit locations
- Show them their assigned storage areas

**Equipment training:**

- Demonstrate proper operation of each piece of equipment they'll use
- Highlight common mistakes and what NOT to do
- Show calibration and temperature verification procedures
- Have the renter **demonstrate back to you** — don't just show, verify understanding

**Cleaning protocols:**

- Walk through your exact cleaning standards — show, don't just tell
- Demonstrate proper sanitizing solution preparation
- Show where cleaning supplies are stored
- Review the cleaning checklist they must complete after each session
- Explain consequences for non-compliance (cleaning fee → warning → termination)

**Safety procedures:**

- Fire: what to do, how the suppression system works, where extinguishers are, evacuation route
- First aid: kit location, incident reporting procedure
- Spills: cleanup protocols for different types (grease, chemical, food)
- Emergency contacts posted and explained

**Administrative:**

- Booking and payment procedures
- Communication expectations (response times, preferred method for urgent issues)
- How to request repairs or report equipment problems

### Step 5: First Session and Ongoing Management

- Check in during or after the first 2–3 sessions to ensure rules are followed
- Weekly check-ins for the first month, then monthly
- Address small issues immediately — patterns form quickly

## Part 5 — Operational Excellence: Running a Safe Multi-User Kitchen

### 5.1 Facility Standards

The NL Food Premises Regulations set the baseline for every licensed kitchen.

**Physical Facility:** Separate food preparation areas from non-food areas. Limit public access to food prep zones. Screened windows and doors to prevent pest entry. Adequate lighting and ventilation. Durable, washable surfaces on floors, walls, and ceilings.

**Water and Sanitation:** Continuous hot and cold potable water under pressure. Hand washing basins in every prep area with soap, single-service towels or air dryers. Two- or three-compartment sink for utensil washing and sanitizing. Food preparation sinks separate from handwashing sinks.

**Temperature Control:** Refrigeration at 4°C (40°F) or below. Freezers at -18°C (0°F) or below. Hot holding at 60°C (140°F) or above. Temperature logs maintained and available for inspection.

**Storage:** Dedicated storage areas per renter in refrigerators, freezers, and dry storage. All stored items labelled with renter's name, date, and contents. Colour-coded labelling system for allergen-risk items recommended. Raw foods stored below ready-to-eat foods — always. First In, First Out (FIFO) rotation.

### 5.2 Allergen Management Program

In a shared kitchen, allergen management is not optional — it's an active, documented program.

1. **Disclosure:** Every renter must submit a full ingredient list with all priority allergens identified before first use and whenever their product changes
2. **No allergen-free claims:** Products made in a shared kitchen cannot be labelled "allergen-free" — labels must state: "Made in a facility that also processes [allergen]"
3. **Scheduling by risk:** Schedule allergen-free production first or at the start of the day. Allergenic products run last or after full sanitation
4. **Dedicated equipment:** Where possible, designate utensils for allergen-free vs. allergen-containing production. Label clearly
5. **Storage separation:** Keep allergen-containing ingredients on separate, clearly marked shelves — below or away from allergen-free ingredients
6. **Cleaning verification:** After an allergen-containing production run, verify cleaning effectiveness before the next renter begins. Hot soapy water removes most allergen proteins; sanitizer alone does not
7. **Communication:** Maintain a shared allergen register visible to all renters, listing which allergens are present in the kitchen and which renter uses them

### 5.3 Cleaning and Sanitation Standards

Cleanliness is the #1 source of friction in shared kitchens. Set standards high and enforce consistently.

**Sanitizing Solutions (prepare fresh daily, verify with test strips):**

| Solution | Concentration | Notes |
|:---------|:--------------|:------|
| **Chlorine (bleach)** | 100 ppm (½ tsp per litre of water) | Loses effectiveness after 3 hours in an open container |
| **Quaternary Ammonium** | 200 ppm | Follow manufacturer directions |
| **Iodine** | 25 ppm | Less common; verify with test strips |

**Renter cleaning responsibilities after each session:**

- [ ] All equipment used — washed, sanitized, returned to proper location
- [ ] All food contact surfaces — cleaned and sanitized
- [ ] Floors — swept and mopped in work area
- [ ] Sinks — cleaned and sanitized
- [ ] Waste containers — emptied if full, bags replaced
- [ ] Storage — items properly labelled and stored
- [ ] Grease traps — emptied if applicable

**Facility owner responsibilities:**

- Daily pre-operational checks before the first renter
- Deep cleaning schedule: weekly floors/walls, monthly equipment, quarterly hoods/vents
- Consider hiring a dedicated housekeeper for end-of-day general cleaning, supply restocking, and deep cleaning tasks

### 5.4 Preventive Maintenance Program

Equipment failure is expensive and disruptive. A preventive maintenance program catches problems before they become emergencies.

**Daily:** Check cooking oil levels and fryer performance. Wipe down cook lines, prep surfaces, and equipment controls. Verify temperatures in all refrigeration units. Empty grease traps and waste containers. Inspect for visible equipment wear or damage.

**Weekly:** Clean condenser coils on refrigeration units. Inspect fryers for leaks, buildup, or worn components. Check ventilation hoods and filters for grease accumulation. Test safety shutoffs and pilot lights. Review floor drains and plumbing connections. Deep clean flat-tops, charbroilers, and cooking surfaces.

**Monthly:** Calibrate oven and fryer thermostats. Inspect plumbing lines and connections. Check electrical panels and cords for wear. Review equipment alignment and levelling. Audit storage areas for organization and cleanliness.

**Semi-Annual:** Fire suppression system inspection by certified provider (mandatory). Ventilation hood and ductwork professional cleaning. Comprehensive refrigeration system service.

**Annual:** Full hood and fire suppression system inspection. Gas line testing and pressure checks. Electrical system evaluation by licensed electrician. Complete equipment service per manufacturer guidelines. Professional pest control assessment.

**Documentation:** Maintain a maintenance log for every piece of equipment. Keep spare parts inventory for common failures. Track maintenance costs to identify replacement candidates.

## Part 6 — Revenue and Pricing Strategy

### 6.1 Pricing Models for Shared Kitchens

According to the 2023 Shared Kitchen Operator Survey conducted by The Food Corridor (the largest data set on shared kitchen operations in North America):

**Hourly Rates**

- National range: $15–$45/hour
- 42% of operators charge between $20–$29/hour
- Factors that justify higher rates: urban location, specialized equipment, prime time slots

**Monthly Membership Plans (Most Popular)**

- 54% of operators offer monthly prepaid plans with no rollover of unused hours
- Members commit to a set number of hours; overage charged at hourly rate
- Provides predictable monthly revenue

**Pay-As-You-Go**

- 39% of operators offer this option
- Best for irregular, seasonal, or one-time users
- Higher per-hour rate than membership plans

**Best practice:** Offer a combination — monthly plans for core, committed renters and pay-as-you-go for casual users. 45% of operators offer two or more billing options.

### 6.2 Revenue Streams Beyond Kitchen Time

**Storage Rentals**

- Dry, refrigerated, and freezer storage can be a significant revenue source
- Typical rates: $10–$50 per shelf/unit, or charge by square foot
- Price strategically — storage space is finite and often in higher demand than kitchen time

**Specialized Equipment Surcharges**

- Charge an additional hourly fee for high-value or specialized equipment (e.g., +$5/hour for a commercial mixer, +$10/hour for specialized bottling equipment)
- Covers maintenance, depreciation, and repair costs

**Special Events and One-Time Use**

- Pop-up dinners, cooking classes, private parties
- Premium pricing: some operators charge $50/hour or $500 flat daily rate for one-time use
- Require staff assistance, additional insurance, and a damage deposit

**Peak vs. Off-Peak Pricing**

- 28% of kitchens offer variable rates by time of day
- Off-peak (typically 7 PM–5 AM): lower rates to maximize utilization
- Weekend/evening premium during high-demand periods

### 6.3 Setting Your Rates

Consider these factors:

1. **Fixed costs:** mortgage/rent, insurance, loan payments, staff, technology/platform fees
2. **Variable costs:** utilities, maintenance, cleaning supplies, pest control
3. **Market rates:** research comparable kitchens in your area
4. **Your unique value:** specialized equipment, storage capacity, location, business support
5. **Target utilization:** how many hours per day/week can your kitchen realistically be booked?

> **Industry advice:** Resist the urge to be the cheapest option. Low pricing creates perceptions of lower quality, sustainability problems, and can attract less serious renters. Price based on your value and costs, not on undercutting competitors.

---

## Part 7 — Record Keeping and Documentation

### 7.1 What to Keep and For How Long

Maintain organized records for a minimum of **6 years** (CRA requirement for tax-related records) and at least **2 years** for health and safety records.

**Facility Records:**

- [ ] Food Establishment Licence (current and previous)
- [ ] Floor plans and equipment specifications
- [ ] Equipment maintenance and calibration logs
- [ ] Temperature monitoring records (fridges, freezers, hot holding)
- [ ] Cleaning schedules and completion checklists
- [ ] Pest control contracts and service records
- [ ] Fire suppression inspection certificates
- [ ] Staff food safety certifications
- [ ] Your insurance policies and renewal documentation
- [ ] Health inspection reports and corrective actions
- [ ] WorkplaceNL registration and assessment records

**Per-Renter Records:**

- [ ] Signed rental agreement
- [ ] Food Handler Certificate (copy with expiry date noted)
- [ ] Certificate of Insurance with additional insured verification
- [ ] Business registration/licence (copy)
- [ ] Food Establishment Licence or application proof
- [ ] Risk assessment documentation
- [ ] Orientation completion acknowledgment (signed)
- [ ] Product descriptions and allergen declarations
- [ ] Booking history and payment records
- [ ] Incident reports, warnings, or violations (if any)

### 7.2 Preparing for Health Inspections

Stay "inspection-ready" at all times rather than scrambling to prepare. Monthly self-inspections using a checklist derived from the Food Premises Regulations will keep you on track.

**Monthly Self-Inspection Checklist:**

- [ ] Licence posted and visible
- [ ] Layout matches submitted floor plan
- [ ] All equipment operational and clean
- [ ] Temperature logs current and in range
- [ ] Handwash basins stocked (soap, towels, hot water)
- [ ] Food stored properly (covered, labelled, temp-controlled, raw below RTE)
- [ ] No pest evidence
- [ ] Cleaning logs up to date
- [ ] Renter storage areas organized and labelled
- [ ] Certified food handler schedule confirms coverage during all operating hours
- [ ] Fire safety equipment accessible and inspection tags current

---

## Part 8 — Emergency Protocols

Develop written emergency procedures for each scenario and post them visibly in the kitchen.

**Power Outage**

- Do not open refrigerators/freezers unnecessarily
- Monitor time: food in a closed fridge stays safe for approximately 4 hours; a full freezer for 48 hours, half-full for 24 hours
- Contact Environmental Health for guidance if the outage exceeds safe limits
- Document time of outage, temperatures when power restored, and any food discarded

**Water Supply Disruption**

- Cannot operate without potable water — cease food preparation immediately
- Notify all renters currently booked
- Contact your water utility and Environmental Health
- Document duration and resolution

**Fire**

- Evacuate immediately; call 911
- The fire suppression system should activate automatically
- Do not re-enter until cleared by the fire department
- Document damage, contact insurance, notify Service NL and Environmental Health
- Arrange professional cleaning and inspection before reopening

**Foodborne Illness Complaint**

- Take every complaint seriously and document thoroughly
- Identify the renter responsible for the implicated food
- Notify Environmental Health immediately
- Preserve any remaining food samples
- Cooperate fully with the investigation

**Equipment Failure**

- Remove failed equipment from service immediately
- If refrigeration fails: monitor food temperatures, relocate to backup if available
- Contact your service provider and document with photos
- Notify affected renters

---

## Part 9 — Legal Considerations When Renting to Chefs

### 9.1 Rental Agreement Essentials

Have a lawyer review your rental agreement — it's a one-time investment of $500–$1,500 that protects you from significant liability. Manitoba Agriculture publishes a useful template: [Kitchen Rental Agreement Contract (PDF)](https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/food-and-ag-processing/starting-a-food-business/pubs/kitchen-rental-agreement-contract.pdf)

**10 essential clauses:**

1. **Compliance with law** — renter agrees to comply with all Food Premises Regulations, municipal bylaws, and federal food safety requirements
2. **Insurance** — minimum coverage amounts, additional insured requirement, 30-day notice of cancellation, automatic access suspension on lapse
3. **Food safety certification** — must maintain a current food handler certificate throughout the rental term
4. **Indemnification** — renter assumes all liability for their products and operations and indemnifies you from any claims arising from their activities
5. **Equipment use and care** — permitted equipment, reporting of malfunctions, responsibility for damage caused by misuse
6. **Cleaning standards** — specific obligations, cleaning checklist, financial penalties for non-compliance
7. **Storage and labelling** — assigned areas, mandatory labelling (name, date, contents), allergen rules
8. **Scheduling and access** — booking process, cancellation policy, after-hours rules, no unauthorized entry
9. **Fees and payment** — rates, deposit, storage fees, equipment surcharges, late payment penalties
10. **Termination** — immediate termination for safety violations, insurance lapse, or serious breach; notice period for voluntary termination; refund and credit policies

### 9.2 Handling Problems: An Escalation Framework

**Issue: Kitchen left unclean**

1. Document with timestamped photos
2. Contact the renter with photos and reference to the cleaning clause
3. First offence: cleaning fee charged per agreement
4. Second offence: written warning
5. Third offence: termination of rental agreement

**Issue: Equipment damaged**

1. Document damage with photos and description
2. Determine cause (misuse vs. normal wear)
3. If renter's fault: file a claim against their "Damage to Premises Rented" coverage
4. Charge repair/replacement per agreement terms

**Issue: Insurance lapse**

1. Send reminders 60 and 30 days before expiry
2. If no renewal received by expiry date: immediately suspend booking access
3. No exceptions, no grace period
4. Restore access only after valid, verified COI received

**Issue: Food safety violation observed**

1. Stop the activity immediately if it poses a risk
2. Document the violation
3. Minor issue: immediate retraining + documented warning
4. Serious or repeated violation: terminate rental agreement
5. If public health risk: notify Environmental Health
