## 🎯 HOW TO BLOCK SPECIFIC HOURS

**You asked**: "I do not see any option on the manager's side to block off hours"

**Answer**: Use the NEW "Booking Requests" page!

### Method 1: Confirm Chef Bookings (PRIMARY METHOD)
1. Chef books 11:00 - 13:00
2. Manager goes to **"Booking Requests"**
3. Manager clicks **"Confirm Booking"**
4. ✅ **Those hours are now BLOCKED** - No other chef can book them

### Method 2: Create Your Own Booking
1. Login as chef (or create test chef account)
2. Book the hours you want to block
3. Login back as manager
4. Go to **"Booking Requests"**
5. Confirm your own booking
6. ✅ **Hours blocked**

### Method 3: Close Entire Day
1. Go to **"Manage Availability"**
2. Click the date
3. Toggle "Kitchen Status" to **OFF** (red)
4. Add reason: "Cleaning Day" or "Maintenance"
5. Click **"Save"**
6. ✅ **Entire day blocked**

## 🔮 OPTIONAL FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

If you want a **dedicated "Block Hours" button** (instead of using booking system):

**Would require**:
- Database migration to add `booking_type` column
- New UI for manager to select hours to block
- Backend endpoints for manual blocks

**Benefit**: Direct blocking without creating bookings
**Drawback**: Requires database schema change

**Current system works well** - most booking platforms use confirmation as blocking mechanism!
