# üîß MANAGER "BLOCK SPECIFIC HOURS" FEATURE

## üìã WHAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKING FOR

You want managers to be able to:
- **Block 11 AM - 1 PM** while keeping the rest of the day available
- **Block multiple time ranges** in a single day
- **See blocked hours** clearly on the calendar
- **Manage blocks** independently of chef bookings

## ‚ùå CURRENT SYSTEM LIMITATIONS

Right now, the system only allows:
1. ‚úÖ Close **entire day** (toggle kitchen OFF)
2. ‚úÖ Set **full day hours** (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM for whole day)
3. ‚úÖ Confirm chef bookings (blocks those times)

**What's MISSING**: Ability to block **partial hours** within a day!

## üéØ THE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Time-Based Date Overrides (RECOMMENDED)
**How it works**:
- Allow MULTIPLE date overrides per day
- Each override blocks a specific time range
- UI shows time slots to block

**Example**:
- Kitchen normally open: 9 AM - 5 PM
- Manager blocks: 11 AM - 1 PM (lunch break)
- Manager blocks: 3 PM - 4 PM (cleaning)
- **Result**: Available times are 9-11 AM, 1-3 PM, 4-5 PM

**Implementation**:
- Remove unique constraint on `(kitchen_id, date)` in `kitchen_date_overrides`
- Allow multiple records for same date
- Add time picker UI for managers
- Show blocked times on calendar

### Option 2: Use Booking System (CURRENT WORKAROUND)
**How it works**:
- Manager "books" the hours they want to block
- These show as confirmed bookings
- Blocks those times from other bookings

**Pros**: No database changes
**Cons**: Not intuitive, mixes bookings with blocks

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTING OPTION 1

I'll implement the proper "Block Hours" feature now!

This requires:
1. ‚úÖ Remove unique constraint from database
2. ‚úÖ Update API to allow multiple overrides per day
3. ‚úÖ Add UI for selecting time ranges to block
4. ‚úÖ Display blocked hours on calendar

Let me do this now...
