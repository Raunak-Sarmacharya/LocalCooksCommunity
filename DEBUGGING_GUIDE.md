# Document Upload Debugging Guide

## Issue Summary
Documents were being uploaded to Vercel Blob successfully, but the URLs were not being saved to NeonDB during application creation.

## Root Cause Identified
The frontend was using two different submission approaches incorrectly:
1. **File Upload Flow**: Frontend uploads files via `/api/upload-file`, gets URLs, then tries to send URLs via JSON
2. **Direct File Flow**: Frontend should send files directly via FormData to `/api/applications`

## Fix Applied

### Frontend Changes (`client/src/components/application/CertificationsForm.tsx`)
1. **Simplified submission logic**: 
   - If user selects files ‚Üí Use FormData submission (backend handles blob upload)
   - If user provides URLs ‚Üí Use JSON submission (backend uses provided URLs)
   - No more pre-uploading files then sending URLs

2. **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed console logs to track submission method

### Backend Changes (`server/routes.ts`)
1. **Enhanced request logging**: Added detailed logging to see what data is received
2. **Maintained existing logic**: Backend already supported both FormData and JSON submissions

## Testing Checklist

### Scenario 1: File Upload Submission
1. Go to application form (page 2)
2. Select "Yes" for Food Safety License
3. Upload a file using the file picker
4. Submit the form
5. **Expected**: Backend should log FormData submission and save blob URL to database

### Scenario 2: URL Input Submission  
1. Go to application form (page 2)
2. Select "Yes" for Food Safety License
3. Switch to "Provide URL" tab
4. Enter a URL (e.g., Google Drive link)
5. Submit the form
6. **Expected**: Backend should log JSON submission and save provided URL to database

### Scenario 3: No Documents
1. Go to application form (page 2)
2. Select "No" for both certifications
3. Submit the form
4. **Expected**: Application created without document URLs

## Debug Logs to Check

### Frontend Console
Look for these log messages:
```
üöÄ Submitting application with data: {...}
üìã Submission method decision: { hasFileUploads: true/false, hasUploadedUrls: true/false, ... }
üéØ Form submission strategy: { hasFiles: true/false, hasUrls: true/false, ... }
üìÅ Submitting with files directly to backend  // File upload path
üîó Submitting with pre-uploaded URLs        // URL input path
üìù Submitting without documents             // No documents path
```

### Backend Console
Look for these log messages:
```
=== APPLICATION SUBMISSION WITH DOCUMENTS ===
Request details: { method: 'POST', contentType: '...', hasFiles: true/false, ... }
üìÑ Uploading food safety license file...    // File upload detected
‚úÖ Food safety license uploaded: [URL]      // Blob upload success
üìÑ Using provided food safety license URL: [URL]  // URL input detected
‚úÖ Food safety license document provided, status set to pending
Final application data: { hasDocuments: true/false, documentUrls: {...} }
‚úÖ Application created successfully: { id: X, hasDocuments: true/false }
```

## Database Verification

### Check Application Record
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  full_name, 
  food_safety_license,
  food_safety_license_url,
  food_safety_license_status,
  food_establishment_cert,
  food_establishment_cert_url,
  food_establishment_cert_status
FROM applications 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Expected Results
- Applications with file uploads should have:
  - `food_safety_license_url`: Vercel Blob URL (starts with `https://`)
  - `food_safety_license_status`: `"pending"`

## Manual Test Commands

### Test File Upload (if debugging locally)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/applications \
  -H "X-User-ID: 1" \
  -F "fullName=Test User" \
  -F "email=test@example.com" \
  -F "phone=+1234567890" \
  -F "foodSafetyLicense=yes" \
  -F "foodEstablishmentCert=no" \
  -F "kitchenPreference=commercial" \
  -F "foodSafetyLicense=@/path/to/test-document.pdf"
```

### Test URL Submission
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/applications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-User-ID: 1" \
  -d '{
    "fullName": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com", 
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "foodSafetyLicense": "yes",
    "foodEstablishmentCert": "no", 
    "kitchenPreference": "commercial",
    "foodSafetyLicenseUrl": "https://example.com/document.pdf"
  }'
```

## Success Indicators
1. ‚úÖ Frontend logs show correct submission method
2. ‚úÖ Backend logs show document URLs being processed
3. ‚úÖ Database contains document URLs after submission
4. ‚úÖ Admin interface shows documents when viewing applications
5. ‚úÖ Quick Approve button appears for ready applications

## Common Issues
- **FormData not detected**: Check Content-Type header (should not be set manually for FormData)
- **Files not in req.files**: Ensure Multer middleware is working correctly
- **URLs not in req.body**: Check JSON parsing and Content-Type for JSON requests
- **Database not updated**: Check storage.createApplication() implementation
