# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Email Authentication Fix for Gmail Blocking

## **Issue Summary**
After your 9:00pm push, Gmail started blocking your emails with this error:
```
550-5.7.26 Your email has been blocked because the sender is unauthenticated. 
550-5.7.26 Gmail requires all senders to authenticate with either SPF or DKIM.
550-5.7.26 Authentication results: 
550-5.7.26  DKIM = did not pass 
550-5.7.26  SPF [localcook.shop] with ip: [23.83.212.18] = did not pass
```

**Root Cause**: Your emails are being sent through MailChannels (IP: 23.83.212.18) but your domain `localcook.shop` doesn't have proper SPF and DKIM authentication configured.

---

## **IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED**

### 1. **Add SPF Record for MailChannels**

Go to your domain registrar's DNS management and add this TXT record:

```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:relay.mailchannels.net ~all
```

**If you already have an SPF record**, modify it to include MailChannels:
```
v=spf1 include:relay.mailchannels.net include:_spf.hostinger.com ~all
```

### 2. **Set Up DKIM for MailChannels**

You have two options:

#### Option A: Use MailChannels DKIM (Recommended)
1. Generate DKIM keys using MailChannels API
2. Add the public key to your DNS as a TXT record

#### Option B: Use Hostinger DKIM (Simpler)
Add this TXT record to your DNS:

```
Type: TXT
Name: hostingermail1._domainkey
Value: v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAzksTUDJ5tnkVYzHujmQ4pUZ9lHlJxh0UnmTJXH8rcn1j74lZClgxgAIn+aNxULISVLYLwsXDXxJxP3mYn1OOJAMXaOYEle0+liMxIShHw3u5IyxDh0IqcvQ5tGEUIVbTU84naUsadWlLUrwHNRvm3tLuxWrBzP+1AKOzX21+XykAn1y0bAX8/5eWu865CTjFI8mFKq7H06rPbUiPJP1jwSp+tsW3/UvK99ZuVspDEnKPA8ZswqUbeO23ZCX2LMI0QLvWoUc57DSLDaSSJ/+kCuQM2Xr5H2OnBdJf5goo3EuAP/uWmTGc+EUa7/vo5WoolWE6tG+vB5OSXnPSP3lnuQIDAQAB
TTL: 3600
```

### 3. **Add DMARC Record (Recommended)**

```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@localcook.shop
TTL: 3600
```

---

## **Environment Variables Check**

Make sure your Vercel environment variables are correctly set:

```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=noreply@localcook.shop
EMAIL_PASS=your-actual-password
EMAIL_FROM=Local Cooks Community <noreply@localcook.shop>
EMAIL_DOMAIN=localcook.shop
```

---

## **Why This Happened After 9pm Push**

1. **Gmail's stricter enforcement**: Gmail tightened authentication requirements in 2024
2. **MailChannels routing**: Your emails might have started routing through MailChannels without proper authentication
3. **Missing DNS records**: Your domain lacks the necessary SPF/DKIM records to authorize MailChannels

---

## **Step-by-Step DNS Configuration**

### For Cloudflare Users:
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ Your Domain â†’ DNS â†’ Records
2. Click "Add record"
3. Add the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records above

### For Other DNS Providers:
1. Login to your domain registrar
2. Find DNS Management/Zone Editor
3. Add the TXT records as specified above

---

## **Testing & Verification**

### 1. **Check DNS Propagation** (Wait 24-48 hours)
```bash
# Check SPF record
nslookup -type=TXT localcook.shop

# Check DKIM record  
nslookup -type=TXT hostingermail1._domainkey.localcook.shop

# Check DMARC record
nslookup -type=TXT _dmarc.localcook.shop
```

### 2. **Test Email Authentication**
- Use [Mail-Tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com)
- Send a test email from your app
- Check for 10/10 authentication score

### 3. **Monitor Email Delivery**
- Test emails to Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo
- Check spam folders initially
- Monitor bounce rates

---

## **Alternative Solutions**

### Option 1: Switch to Direct SMTP
Update your environment variables to use Hostinger directly:
```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
```

### Option 2: Use SendGrid/Mailgun
Consider switching to a dedicated email service:
```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=apikey
EMAIL_PASS=your-sendgrid-api-key
```

---

## **Timeline for Fix**

- **Immediate (0-1 hour)**: Add DNS records
- **Propagation (24-48 hours)**: DNS records become active globally
- **Resolution (48-72 hours)**: Email delivery should normalize

---

## **Monitoring Commands**

Run these to check your fix:

```bash
# Test DKIM setup
node scripts/test-dkim-setup.js

# Check email configuration
node scripts/test-db-connection.js
```

---

## **Emergency Workaround**

If you need immediate email delivery:

1. **Use a different email service temporarily**
2. **Send critical emails manually** through Gmail/Outlook
3. **Notify users** about potential email delays

---

## **Prevention for Future**

1. **Monitor email authentication** with Google Postmaster Tools
2. **Set up alerts** for bounce rates > 5%
3. **Test email changes** in staging before production
4. **Keep DNS records updated** when changing email providers

**Status**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**
