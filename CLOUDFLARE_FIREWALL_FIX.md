# 🛡️ Cloudflare Firewall Check for MailChannels IPs

## **Issue:** 
Your Cloudflare dashboard shows denied IPs, which could include MailChannels servers needed for email delivery.

---

## **MailChannels IP Ranges to Whitelist:**

Based on my research, MailChannels uses these IP ranges:
```
23.83.208.0/20
23.83.212.18 (specific IP from your error)
185.12.80.0/22
188.172.128.0/20
192.161.144.0/20
216.198.0.0/18
```

---

## **Step-by-Step Fix:**

### **1. Check Current Firewall Rules**
1. Log into Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Select `localcook.shop` domain
3. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Firewall Rules**
4. Look for any rules blocking the IPs mentioned above

### **2. Check Security Events**
1. Go to **Security** > **Events**
2. Look for blocked requests from IPs starting with:
   - `23.83.212.x`
   - `23.83.208.x`
   - Any MailChannels-related blocks

### **3. Create Whitelist Rule (If Needed)**
If you find MailChannels IPs being blocked:

1. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Firewall Rules**
2. Click **Create Firewall Rule**
3. **Rule Name:** `Allow MailChannels Email Servers`
4. **Field:** `IP Source Address`
5. **Operator:** `is in`
6. **Value:** 
   ```
   23.83.208.0/20
   185.12.80.0/22
   188.172.128.0/20
   192.161.144.0/20
   216.198.0.0/18
   ```
7. **Action:** `Allow`
8. Click **Deploy**

### **4. Alternative: IP Access Rules**
Or create IP Access Rules:

1. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Tools**
2. Find **IP Access Rules**
3. Add these IP ranges with **Action: Allow**:
   - `23.83.208.0/20`
   - `185.12.80.0/22`
   - `188.172.128.0/20`
   - `192.161.144.0/20`
   - `216.198.0.0/18`

## **Important Notes:**

- **Email vs Web Traffic:** These IPs are for email delivery, not web traffic
- **SMTP Traffic:** MailChannels handles SMTP, which doesn't go through Cloudflare's web proxy
- **Primary Issue:** The main problem is still the SPF record, not firewall blocking

---

## **Verification:**

After making firewall changes:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes
2. Send a test email from your application
3. Check Cloudflare Security Events for any new blocks

---

## **Priority Order:**

1. **FIRST:** Fix the SPF record (most critical)
2. **SECOND:** Check and fix any Cloudflare firewall blocks
3. **THIRD:** Test email delivery

The SPF record fix is the primary solution - the firewall check is just to ensure nothing else is interfering.
