## PART 3: ADD-ON & BUNDLING SYSTEM

### 3.1 Why Add-Ons Matter

A chef books storage on Monday, then requests equipment by Wednesday. An intuitive add-on system prevents:
- Abandoned shopping carts
- Administrative overhead
- Lost revenue opportunities

**Example Workflow:**
1. Chef books cold storage for 30 days ($200)
2. Mid-booking, chef needs commercial mixer
3. One-click "Add Equipment" → Browse available equipment → Add mixer
4. System calculates: $200 (storage) + $150 (mixer) = $350, pro-rated dates
5. Single invoice, single contract

---

### 3.2 Add-On Request Interface

**For Renters (Add-On Request):**

CURRENT BOOKING SUMMARY:

Cold Storage: Dec 1 - Dec 31 ($200)

Location: Kitchen Owner Name

Status: Confirmed

[+ ADD STORAGE/EQUIPMENT]

QUICK ADD OPTIONS:
☐ More storage space (from same host)
☐ Equipment rental (from same host)
☐ Extend current booking
☐ Browse marketplace for other hosts

text

**When Renter Clicks "Add Equipment":**

1. **Filter to This Host's Inventory:** Show only items available during booking dates
2. **Duration Auto-Sync:** Equipment rental period auto-matches storage dates (but allow override)

4. **One Checkout:** Combined invoice for storage + equipment
5. **Confirmation:** Single email with both items listed

**For Hosts (Manage Add-Ons):**

### 3.3 Bundling Strategy (Advanced)

**Host Creates Bundles (Optional Premium Feature):**

BUNDLE EXAMPLE: "Small Bakery Starter Kit"

Ingredients: Cold storage (500 sq ft, 30 days) + Oven + Mixer + Prep Table

Regular price if rented separately: $200 + $150 + $100 + $75 = $525

Bundle discount: -15% = $446/month

Chef clicks one "Book Bundle" button

Reduces friction, increases perceived value

text

**Bundle Management UI:**

CREATE BUNDLE:
Bundle Name: Bakery Starter Kit
Select Items to Bundle:
☑ Cold Storage (500 sq ft) — $200
☑ Commercial Oven (Convection) — $150
☑ 40qt Mixer — $100

BUNDLE PRICING:
Original Total: $525
Bundle Price: $446 (15% off)
Savings: $79/month

[Show savings calculator]

text

**Why Bundles Work:**
