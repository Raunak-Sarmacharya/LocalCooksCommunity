## Modern Design Principles

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear sections with headers
2. **Intuitive Icons**: Clock icons for time, trash for delete
3. **Color Coding**:
   - Green: Available/default hours
   - Orange: Blocked hours
   - Red: Fully closed
4. **Inline Actions**: Delete buttons right next to blocks
5. **Expandable Form**: "Add" button reveals time picker
6. **Validation**: Prevent overlapping blocks
